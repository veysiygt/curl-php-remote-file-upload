# Curl-Php-Remote-File-Upload

You will be able to upload files to a remote system with the codes I have written.
I added what all the codes do as a comment line next to them.
To simulate the script, I created a file called upload.php to see how the code works.
To see how the code works, create a folder named fileupload in localhost and drop index.php, upload.php files there and run it.
You can edit and use the changes in the specified places.
You can use it by making a few changes in your projects
